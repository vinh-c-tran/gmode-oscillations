# g-mode Oscillations Hyperons

This repository consists of the code used to ultimately calculate the $g$-mode oscillations for compositions including nucleons and hyperons in the context of relativistic mean field models. This is split up into three separate code segments that do three different things
1. Calculate the Equilibrium Parameters
2. Calculate the Adiabatic Sound Speed/Sound Speed Difference
3. Calculate Structure, g-mode oscillations and Tidal Deformability
