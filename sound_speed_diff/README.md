# Calculating the Adiabatic Sound Speed
This is step 2, after calculating the equilibrium structure and determining the pressure and energy density. The total derivative of this quantity is the equilibrium sound speed $c_e^2 = dp/d\epsilon$. In this step, we want to calculate a related quantity, the adiabatic sound speed $c_s^2 = \partial p/\partial \epsilon$ taken while holding the composition of the star fixed. We do this in this work by using the following expression
\[
  c_s^2 = c_e^2
\]
